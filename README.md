# What Is This?
With this repo, you can save your website visitors number on AWS Dynomodb and you can easily expose as api with AWS Lambda Function. Ä°f you want to add visitor number to your website you should use javascript. In this repo, you will learn your website visitors. 




## Creating Services
First you should create an AWS account. After that you need to create a table named VisitorCount from DynamoDB and partition key must be id(String).

Than you should edit Item editor like this. After that you should create a Lambda and API Gateway.




## Lambda Function
> This repo does not explain AWS setup. If you are having problems about setting up AWS services. Please review the required documents. 

First we are going to write a Lambda Function. Then you will install the `lambda_function.py`. Import or copy everything like this.

After that create a Get Method in API Gateway. Connect the API Gateway with DynamoDB. After that you should Deploy API and Enable CORS.

If you're making the right adjustments, you need this building.




## Usage of HTML and Javascript
In this part, we should add javascript command in our website code. You should Write this command inside the HTML code.

```html
<script>
    		fetch('https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta') // You should change the link.
      		.then(response => response.json())
      		.then((data) => {
        	document.getElementById('visitor_counter').innerText = data.Count
      		})
</script>
```

With this command now you can call the value. 

If you want to write this value to your website, you should add this command to your HTML code. 
```<span id="visitor_counter" />```

After all of that, you can use visitor counter in your website.
